### [Link to website](https://projects.jules.pet/motion-converter/)
## What is this project?
* This project is a webpage which can convert velocities into weird units.
* This is a project inspired by boredom
## What is this project not?
* This project is not going to be 100 percent precise due to JS's limitation with numbers and me not caring enough to find out if there is another way
* JS is not my main language so i dont really care
* Neither is html or css
